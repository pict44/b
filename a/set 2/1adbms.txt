1.Create a database with suitable example using MongoDB and implement Inserting and saving document (batch insert, insert validation).
To create a database in MongoDB with document insertion (including batch insert and insert validation) as a beginner, follow these easy steps with examples.

Step 1: Create a Database and Collection
use studentDB
This switches to (or creates) a database called studentDB.[1][2]

Step 2: Insert a Single Document
Now, insert a document into a collection called students.
db.students.insertOne({
  name: "Ankit",
  age: 20,
  branch: "IT"
})
This command creates the students collection and inserts one student record.[3][4]

Step 3: Batch Insert Multiple Documents
To insert multiple student documents at once, use insertMany():
db.students.insertMany([
  { name: "Riya", age: 21, branch: "CSE" },
  { name: "Amit", age: 22, branch: "ECE" },
  { name: "Priya", age: 20, branch: "IT" }
])
This saves an array of student documents in a single command.[5][6]
 
Step 4: Insert Validation with Schema
To validate your documents (for example, every student must have a name and age), create the collection with a schema validator:
db.createCollection("validated_students", {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: "object",
      required: ["name", "age"],
      properties: {
        name: { bsonType: "string", description: "must be a string" },
        age: { bsonType: "int", minimum: 18, maximum: 30, description: "must be a number between 18 and 30" }
      }
    }
  }
})

Try inserting a valid and invalid document:
// This should work
db.validated_students.insertOne({ name: "Sneha", age: 22 })

// This will fail (missing age)
db.validated_students.insertOne({ name: "Rohit" })

The first command inserts successfully, while the second will cause a validation error because age is missing.[7]
