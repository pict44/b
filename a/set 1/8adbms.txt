8)Create and drop different types of indexes and explain () to show the advantage of the indexes. (easy db and use insertMany)

 
Step 1: Insert sample data with insertMany
use libraryDB

db.books.insertMany([
  { title: "MongoDB Basics", author: "Alice", year: 2020 },
  { title: "Java Programming", author: "Bob", year: 2018 },
  { title: "Web Development", author: "Alice", year: 2021 },
  { title: "Data Structures", author: "Charlie", year: 2019 },
  { title: "Microservices", author: "Bob", year: 2022 }
])

 
Step 2: Create different types of indexes
1.Create a single field index on author:
db.books.createIndex({ author: 1 })

Advantage: Speeds up queries filtering by author (ascending order).
 
2.Create a compound index on author and year:
db.books.createIndex({ author: 1, year: -1 })

Advantage: Efficient for queries filtering by author and sorting/restricting by year (descending).
 
3.Create a unique index on title:
db.books.createIndex({ title: 1 }, { unique: true })

Advantage: Ensures no duplicate book titles in the collection.
 
4.Create a text index on title and author to support text search:
db.books.createIndex({ title: "text", author: "text" })

Advantage: Allows fast full-text search on title and author fields.
 
Step 3: Drop indexes
•Drop single index by key pattern:
db.books.dropIndex({ author: 1 })

•Drop compound index:
db.books.dropIndex({ author: 1, year: -1 })

•Drop all indexes except _id (default index):
db.books.dropIndexes()
