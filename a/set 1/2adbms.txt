2.Create a database with suitable example using MongoDB and implement Removing document. Updating document (document replacement, using modifiers, up inserts, updating multiple documents, returning updated documents).

Step 1: Create Database and Insert Documents (insertMany)
Switch to your database and use insertMany() to add several students at once:
use studentDB

db.students.insertMany([
  { name: "Amit", age: 20, branch: "CSE" },
  { name: "Sneha", age: 21, branch: "ECE" },
  { name: "Riya", age: 22, branch: "IT" }
])
This command creates the database and collection, and insert all three documents at once.
 
Step 2: Remove Documents
To remove students from the collection:
•Remove one student:
db.students.deleteOne({ name: "Amit" })

•Remove all students in the IT branch:
db.students.deleteMany({ branch: "IT" })
This removes either one document or multiple documents that match the query.
 
Step 3: Update Documents
a) Document Replacement
Replace Sneha’s record fully:
db.students.replaceOne({ name: "Sneha" }, { name: "Sneha", age: 22, branch: "Civil" })
This replaces the entire document that matches name: "Sneha" with the new document.

b) Using Modifiers ($set)
Update Riya’s age only, keeping other fields unchanged:
db.students.updateOne(
  { name: "Riya" },
  { $set: { age: 23 } }
)
The $set modifier just changes age for Riya.

c) Upsert (Update or Insert if not exists)
If you want to update a record, and if no record matches, insert a new one:
db.students.updateOne(
  { name: "Ankit" },
  { $set: { age: 24, branch: "CS" } },
  { upsert: true }
)
If "Ankit" doesn’t exist, this creates it.

d) Updating Multiple Documents
Increase age by 1 for all students in the ECE branch:
db.students.updateMany(
  { branch: "ECE" },
  { $inc: { age: 1 } }
)
This uses $inc modifier on multiple matching documents.

e) Returning Updated Documents
There isn’t a direct way to see the updated documents in the same command, but you can run a find afterwards:
db.students.find({ branch: "ECE" })
This shows the documents after update.
 
These operations let you easily add, remove, and update multiple records for a simple student database in MongoDB.
